This is AASM

AASM is an evolution of the Rails plugin acts_as_state_machine.

AASM Features

Everything you've come to know and love from acts_as_state_machine, and then some:

- Separation from Rails
  * Mix into any Ruby class
- Persistence hooks so state can be saved in whatever floats your boat
  * e.g. ActiveRecord, Marshal, etc.

See the TODO for more.
